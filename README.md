# VirtuCare

**VirtuCare** is a browser-based simulation designed to help healthcare professionals practice patient interviews in a realistic, low-pressure environment. The system introduces users to randomized virtual patients with varying symptoms and personalities, providing a dynamic learning experience with voice interaction.

## Features
- Voice recognition allows users to conduct interviews naturally in the browser
- Randomized virtual patients with differing symptoms and responses
- Real-time feedback and a summary screen highlighting missed and captured information
- Encourages reflective learning and soft skill development in clinical communication

## Purpose
This project was developed to apply emerging technology and instructional design principles to soft skill training in healthcare. VirtuCare offers a low-risk environment for improving patient communication, active listening, and diagnostic questioning.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Web Speech API for browser-based voice recognition
